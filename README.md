# Get-and-clean-data
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data" Feb.2015, part of the Data Science specialization. The dataset being used is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The R scrip file does the foolowing: 
1, Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2, Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3, Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4, Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5, Creates a  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
